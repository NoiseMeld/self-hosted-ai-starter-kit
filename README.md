## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file. 
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you'll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it's not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Managing the Docker Stack

### Starting the Services

#### Foreground Mode (Default)
Running in foreground mode shows live logs and is great for development:

```bash
# For CPU setups
docker compose --profile cpu up

# For Nvidia GPU setups  
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up

# For AMD GPU setups
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up

# For Mac / Apple Silicon users
docker compose up
```

**What you'll see:**
- Live logs from all services in your terminal
- Progress of model downloads and service initialization
- The terminal will stay occupied showing ongoing activity
- Use **Ctrl+C** to stop all services

#### Background Mode (Detached)
Running in background mode frees up your terminal:

```bash
# For CPU setups
docker compose --profile cpu up -d

# For Nvidia GPU setups
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up -d

# For AMD GPU setups  
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up -d

# For Mac / Apple Silicon users
docker compose up -d
```

**Benefits of background mode:**
- Terminal is immediately available for other commands
- Services run in the background
- Use `docker compose logs -f` to view logs when needed

### Stopping the Services

#### Stop Running Services
```bash
# Stop services (keeps containers and data)
docker compose stop

# Stop and remove containers (keeps volumes and images)
docker compose down
```

#### Force Stop from Foreground Mode
If running in foreground mode, use **Ctrl+C** to stop all services gracefully.

### Viewing Logs and Status

#### Check Service Status
```bash
# View running containers
docker compose ps

# View all containers (including stopped)
docker compose ps -a
```

#### View Logs
```bash
# View all service logs
docker compose logs

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f n8n
docker compose logs -f ollama-cpu
docker compose logs -f postgres
docker compose logs -f qdrant
```

#### Monitor Resource Usage
```bash
# View container resource usage
docker stats
```

### Restarting Services

#### Restart All Services
```bash
# Restart all services
docker compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart n8n
```

#### Rebuild and Restart
```bash
# Pull latest images and restart
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

### Common Scenarios

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start in foreground to see logs during development
docker compose --profile cpu up

# When done, stop with Ctrl+C
# Or open new terminal and run:
docker compose stop
```

#### Long-running Setup
```bash
# Start in background for long-running use
docker compose --profile cpu up -d

# Check status periodically
docker compose ps

# View logs when needed
docker compose logs -f

# Stop when done
docker compose down
```

#### Troubleshooting
```bash
# View logs to diagnose issues
docker compose logs -f

# Restart problematic service
docker compose restart [service-name]

# Complete restart
docker compose down && docker compose --profile cpu up -d
```

## Upgrading

* ### For Nvidia GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

* ### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

* ### For Non-GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose --profile cpu pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## Cleanup

To completely remove the Docker stack and all related resources:

### For CPU setups:

```bash
# Remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose --profile cpu down -v

# Also remove all images (for complete cleanup)
docker compose --profile cpu down -v --rmi all
```

### For Nvidia GPU setups:

```bash
# Remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia down -v

# Also remove all images (for complete cleanup)
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia down -v --rmi all
```

### For AMD GPU setups:

```bash
# Remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose --profile gpu-amd down -v

# Also remove all images (for complete cleanup)
docker compose --profile gpu-amd down -v --rmi all
```

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users:

```bash
# Remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose down -v

# Also remove all images (for complete cleanup)
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```

### Additional cleanup (optional):

```bash
# Remove local n8n configuration data
rm -rf ~/.n8n

# Remove shared directory contents
rm -rf ./shared/*
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-v` flag removes named volumes. The `--rmi all` flag removes all images used by services.
> Use `--rmi local` to only remove images that don't have a custom tag.

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.

## 2025-09-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team, Community

### Decision

Create a self-hosted AI starter kit that provides a complete Docker-based development environment for AI workflow automation, targeting developers and AI enthusiasts who want to experiment with open source AI tools locally without complex setup or cloud dependencies.

### Context

The AI development landscape is fragmented with complex toolchain setup requirements, scattered learning resources, and heavy dependence on cloud services. Many developers and AI enthusiasts want to experiment with AI workflows but face significant barriers including complicated installations, integration challenges, and privacy concerns with cloud-based solutions.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Cloud-based Solution**
   - Pros: No local setup, always updated, scalable
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, ongoing costs, internet dependency, vendor lock-in

2. **Individual Tool Installation Guide**  
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, users learn each component
   - Cons: Complex setup, integration challenges, inconsistent environments

3. **Virtual Machine Image**
   - Pros: Complete pre-configured environment, easy distribution
   - Cons: Large download size, resource intensive, update complexity

### Rationale

The Docker Compose approach provides the optimal balance of simplicity, flexibility, and local control. It enables one-command deployment while maintaining transparency of individual components. The hardware-specific profiles ensure optimal performance across diverse development machines, and the pre-configured integrations eliminate common setup frustrations while preserving the ability to customize and extend.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Dramatically reduced time-to-first-AI-workflow for developers
- Complete local data privacy and control
- Standardized development environment reducing "works on my machine" issues
- Educational value through transparent, modifiable configuration
- Foundation for advanced AI development patterns

**Negative:**
- Docker dependency requirement
- Local hardware resource consumption
- Limited to open source AI models
- Requires basic Docker knowledge for troubleshooting
- Initial learning curve for workflow automation concepts

## 2025-09-02: Docker Compose Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Community Contributors

### Decision

Use Docker Compose with hardware-specific profiles (cpu, gpu-nvidia, gpu-amd) rather than a single configuration, enabling optimal performance across different development environments while maintaining simplicity.

### Context

AI workloads have vastly different performance characteristics depending on available hardware. CPU-only inference is suitable for learning and light development, while GPU acceleration is essential for serious AI development. Users have diverse hardware configurations and need the flexibility to optimize for their specific setup.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Pros: Simpler documentation, fewer configuration options
   - Cons: Suboptimal performance for GPU users, complex conditional logic

2. **Separate Docker Compose Files**
   - Pros: Clear separation, easy to maintain
   - Cons: Multiple files to maintain, unclear which to use

3. **Runtime Hardware Detection**
   - Pros: Automatic optimization, no user decisions needed  
   - Cons: Complex implementation, difficult to debug, unreliable detection

### Rationale

Compose profiles provide the best balance of simplicity and flexibility. Users can easily select their optimal configuration with a single flag, while maintaining a single docker-compose.yml file for easier maintenance. The profile approach is well-documented in Docker Compose and provides clear separation of concerns.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal performance for each hardware type
- Single file to maintain
- Clear user choice with simple commands
- Easy to add new hardware profiles in future

**Negative:**
- Slightly more complex initial documentation
- Users must understand their hardware capabilities
- Profile-specific testing required
